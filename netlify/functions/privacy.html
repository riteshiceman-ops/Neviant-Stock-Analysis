  <h1>Privacy Policy – Neviant Stock Analysis GPT</h1>
  <p class="muted">Last updated: 22 Feb 2026</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy describes how the Neviant Stock Analysis GPT (“the GPT”, “we”, “us”) handles data when you use it.
    The GPT can call external APIs via Netlify serverless functions to retrieve market data for stocks.
  </p>

  <h2>What data we process</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Query inputs</strong> you provide for analysis, such as stock ticker/company name, exchange, date ranges/timeframes, and request type (quote/candles/fundamentals).</li>
    <li><strong>Technical request metadata</strong> generated by hosting providers (e.g., IP address, timestamps) as part of standard server logs.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We do <strong>not</strong> request or need your passwords, brokerage credentials, or payment details.
  </p>

  <h2>How we use data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To fulfill your request by fetching stock market data and returning results to the GPT.</li>
    <li>To maintain reliability and troubleshoot errors (e.g., reviewing basic logs).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What we store</h2>
  <p>
    We do not intentionally store your chat content or personal data in our own database.
    Our hosting provider (Netlify) may retain standard access logs for a limited period for security and operational purposes.
  </p>

  <h2>Third-party services</h2>
  <p>The GPT uses third-party services to provide functionality:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Netlify</strong> (hosting/serverless functions) – processes requests to our API endpoints.</li>
    <li><strong>Alpha Vantage</strong> – US market data provider (quotes, time series, and fundamentals where available).</li>
    <li><strong>Groww</strong> – India market data provider (quotes/candles), accessed through our server-side proxy.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Requests to these providers may include the stock symbol, exchange, timeframe, and related parameters needed to retrieve the requested data.
  </p>

  <h2>API keys and security</h2>
  <p>
    Provider API keys/tokens are stored as encrypted environment variables in Netlify and are not exposed to end users.
    We take reasonable steps to protect these secrets and to avoid returning sensitive configuration data in responses.
  </p>

  <h2>Data retention</h2>
  <p>
    We do not maintain a user database.
    Standard server logs, if enabled, are retained per the hosting provider’s default retention policies.
  </p>

  <h2>Your choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Do not submit personal information in your prompts if you do not want it processed.</li>
    <li>You may stop using the GPT at any time.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Contact</h2>

    If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, contact:

  <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>
    This GPT provides informational analysis only and is not financial advice.
    Always do your own research and consult a qualified professional before making investment decisions.
